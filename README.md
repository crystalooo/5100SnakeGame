An attempt at teaching a Snake agent to learn how to beat the famous Snake Game, and hopefully draw insights from its learning to apply to real-life scenarios.

The starting point of this system is a valuable tutorial series created by Python Engineer - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnslRFeH2UrDh7vUmJ60YrmWd64mTTKV. PyTorch and PyGame are used in this tutorial. We hope to add our own insight and algorithms and build upon this.
